        Icarus is a 2D platformer prototype game with movement techniques such as ziplines, dashes, and wall jumps. It is written in Unity C#.
        <br>
        <br>
        The project was started for fun. The aim of the project was to try out the 2D environment of Unity engine. It is not yet fully developed and has been discontinued.
        <br>
        <br>
        Considering images can be generated through Stable Defusion, many art assets for 2D game such as Icarus could be made with ease. The background of the preview video was generated from Stable Defusion with my prompts.
